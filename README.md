# Welcome to your Dictaphone app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project to improve my existing dictaphone app.

I added nativeWind and the [rnr library](https://rnr-docs.vercel.app/) to make it easier to develop.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    pnpm start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## ðŸ“± Android

build the app

```
eas build -p android --profile preview
```
